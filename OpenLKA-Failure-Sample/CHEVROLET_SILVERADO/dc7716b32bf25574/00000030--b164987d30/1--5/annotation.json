        "reasoning_steps": "Evaluated potential causes: Faded Laneline is unlikely as the markings are visible but not distinct. Laneline Occlusion is not evident. Pavement-Laneline Contrast is the most likely cause due to the low visibility of the Left Laneline. Insufficient Light and Sun Glaring are not present.",
