        "reasoning_steps": "Evaluated potential causes: Faded Laneline is unlikely as the line appears intact. Laneline Occlusion is not present. Pavement-Laneline Contrast is the most likely cause due to the line's lower visibility. Insufficient Light and Sun Glaring are not factors as the scene is well-lit. Laneline Transition and Road Splices and Cracks are not applicable.",
