        "step_4": "The primary cause of the detection failure is the faded laneline, as the markings appear worn and nearly invisible. The low contrast between the pavement and the lane markings exacerbates the issue, making it difficult for the system to detect them accurately.",

The lighting conditions are nighttime but well lit, with visible streetlights and vehicle headlights providing adequate illumination. The road appears dry, with no visible reflections or wet patches. The road type is a multiple-lane road, as there are several lanes visible in each direction. Lane markings are sharp and clear, with high contrast against the road surface. There is a construction zone ahead, indicated by visible barriers and signs, suggesting a road segment transition.",

Pavement-Laneline Contrast is not an issue as the lines are clear. Insufficient Light is not a factor due to adequate lighting. Sun Glaring is not applicable at night.
