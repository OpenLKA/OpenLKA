Pavement-Laneline Contrast is low, making it a likely cause. Insufficient Light is a contributing factor due to nighttime conditions. Sun Glaring is not applicable. Laneline Transition and Road Splices and Cracks are not observed. Multiple Factors: Low contrast and insufficient lighting are the main issues.",
        "reason": "Pavement-Laneline Contrast and Insufficient Light - The low contrast between the laneline and the road surface, combined with insufficient lighting, is the primary cause of detection failure.",
        "step_5": "Cross-checked the conclusions with the input images. The raw frame confirms nighttime conditions with low contrast lane markings. The binary mask shows limited detection, especially on the right side, consistent with the analysis. No contradictions found.",
        "verification": "The analysis is consistent with the input images. The nighttime conditions and low contrast are evident in the raw frame, and the binary mask supports the conclusion of poor right laneline detection. No new evidence contradicts the findings.",
