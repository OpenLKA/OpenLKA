        "step_2": "In the Instance Mask, the leftmost line is the Left_Road_Edge, followed by the Left_Laneline, Right_Laneline, and the Right_Road_Edge. In the Binary Mask, the Left_Laneline is less visible compared to the Right_Laneline, indicating more detection issues on the left side.",
        "laneline_failure_area": "A. Most of the left road markings are detected abnormally. The Left_Laneline is less visible in the Binary Mask, particularly in the middle section of the Raw Frame.",
        "step_3": "The Left_Laneline in the Raw Frame is less visible in the Binary Mask, especially in the middle section. This area does not show any visible occlusion or glare, but the lane line may be faded or have low contrast against the pavement.",
        "laneline_failure_area_description": "The Left_Laneline is less visible in the middle section of the Raw Frame. There are no visible obstructions or glare, but the line may be faded or have low contrast.",
        "step_4": "The Left_Laneline appears less visible due to potential fading or low contrast with the pavement. The line is not occluded, and lighting is sufficient, ruling out other causes like occlusion or insufficient light.",
        "reasoning_steps": "Evaluated potential causes: Faded Laneline is likely due to less visibility in the Binary Mask. Occlusion and lighting issues are ruled out as the scene is clear and well-lit.",
        "reason": "Faded Laneline - The Left_Laneline may be faded or have low contrast, leading to detection issues.",
        "step_5": "Cross-checked the Raw Frame, Binary Mask, and Instance Mask. The analysis is consistent with the images, confirming the Left_Laneline is less visible due to fading or low contrast. No contradictions found.",
        "verification": "The analysis is consistent across all images. The Left_Laneline's reduced visibility is likely due to fading or low contrast, as supported by the Binary Mask and Raw Frame.",
