        "step_2": "The instance mask shows multiple lane lines, but the binary mask indicates poor detection, especially on the left side. The left laneline is less visible in the binary mask, suggesting more detection issues on the left.",
        "laneline_failure_area": "A. Most of the left road markings are detected abnormally. The left side of the road in the raw frame shows less distinct lane markings.",
        "step_3": "The left side of the road in the raw frame has less distinct lane markings, possibly due to low contrast and construction zone interference. The lighting might also contribute to the reduced visibility.",
        "laneline_failure_area_description": "The left side of the road shows less distinct lane markings. Factors include low contrast between the lane lines and pavement, and possible interference from construction cones.",
        "step_4": "The primary cause of detection failure is likely the low contrast between the lane lines and the pavement, exacerbated by nighttime lighting conditions. The construction zone may also contribute to the issue.",
        "reasoning_steps": "Evaluated potential causes: Faded Laneline is unlikely as markings are visible; Laneline Occlusion is possible due to construction cones; Pavement-Laneline Contrast is the most likely cause due to low visibility; Insufficient Light is less likely due to streetlights; Sun Glaring is not applicable; Laneline Transition is possible due to construction; Road Splices and Cracks are not visible. The primary cause is low contrast, with construction zone interference as a secondary factor.",
        "reason": "Pavement-Laneline Contrast - The lane lines blend with the pavement under nighttime lighting, and construction zone interference may contribute.",
        "step_5": "Cross-checked the conclusions with the input images. The raw frame supports the low contrast and construction zone interference conclusions. The binary mask's poor detection on the left aligns with the identified issues. No contradictions found.",
        "verification": "The analysis is consistent with the input images. The nighttime lighting and construction zone are confirmed as contributing factors to the lane detection issues. No new evidence contradicts the conclusions.",
