The lighting is generally normal, with dry road surfaces and no significant moisture or reflections.

This issue is consistently observed across different lanes, including left, right, and middle sections. The faded condition of the lane lines leads to incomplete detection, as evidenced by visual analysis of raw frames and binary masks. The problem is further compounded by the blending of faded lines with the road surface, reducing their visibility and detection accuracy.",

This issue is particularly noted in the right lane, where the markings blend with the road surface, making them difficult to detect. The low contrast is often associated with faded lane lines, contributing to the overall detection challenges. Visual evidence from raw frames and binary masks supports the observation of reduced visibility due to low contrast."
