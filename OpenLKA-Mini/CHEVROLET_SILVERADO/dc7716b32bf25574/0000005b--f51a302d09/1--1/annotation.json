The scenes are typically overcast or partly cloudy, providing diffused lighting without extreme brightness or darkness.

This wear is often exacerbated by low contrast with the pavement, shadow occlusion, or partial occlusion by vehicles. The faded condition of the lane lines makes them less visible, leading to detection challenges. Visual evidence from the raw frames consistently shows worn markings, missing segments, and blending with the road surface, supporting the conclusion that faded lanelines are the primary issue.",
