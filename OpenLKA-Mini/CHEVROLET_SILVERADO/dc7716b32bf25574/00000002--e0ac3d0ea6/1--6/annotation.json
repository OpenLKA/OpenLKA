        "laneline_failure_area_description": "The Left Laneline area shows low contrast markings that blend with the road surface, making them difficult to detect. This is particularly evident in the middle section of the frame.",
        "step_4": "The primary cause of the detection failure is the low contrast between the pavement and the lane markings. The markings are not distinct enough against the road surface, leading to poor detection.",
        "reasoning_steps": "Evaluated potential causes: Faded Laneline is not applicable as markings are present. Laneline Occlusion is not observed. Pavement-Laneline Contrast is the primary issue due to blending. Insufficient Light and Sun Glaring are not factors. Laneline Transition and Road Splices are not present. Multiple Factors are not needed as contrast is the main issue.",
        "reason": "Pavement-Laneline Contrast - The lane markings blend with the road surface, reducing visibility.",
        "step_5": "Cross-checked the conclusions with the input images. The low contrast of lane markings is consistent with the Binary and Instance Masks, confirming the primary cause of detection failure. No contradictions were found.",
        "verification": "The analysis is consistent with the input images. The low contrast of lane markings is evident in both the Raw Frame and Binary Mask, supporting the conclusion of pavement-laneline contrast as the primary issue.",
