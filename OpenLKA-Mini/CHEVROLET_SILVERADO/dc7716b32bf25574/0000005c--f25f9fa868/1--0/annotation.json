The lane markings are visibly worn and blend with the pavement, reducing visibility and detection accuracy. This issue is consistently observed across multiple analyses, with evidence from raw frames showing faded lines that are nearly invisible in some areas, leading to incomplete detection in binary masks.",

This issue is highlighted in several analyses, where the raw frames show worn-out lane markings that contribute to detection failures."
