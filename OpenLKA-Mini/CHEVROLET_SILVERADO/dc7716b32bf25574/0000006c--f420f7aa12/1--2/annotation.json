        "scene_description": "The scene descriptions across the analyses consistently depict urban roads with faded lane lines, often under overcast or partly cloudy conditions. The lighting is generally normal, with no extreme brightness or darkness, and the pavement is dry. Intersections are common, with cross streets and potential turning arrows. Shadows are occasionally present, contributing to occlusion issues.",
        "primary_reason": "Faded Laneline",
        "primary_description": "The primary cause of lane detection failure is the physical wear of the lane markings, making them difficult to detect. This issue is prevalent in both left and right lanes, particularly in the middle sections where the lines are faded. The faded lines blend with the road surface, reducing visibility and contributing to detection failure. Visual evidence from raw frames consistently shows visibly worn lane lines, and binary masks often fail to highlight these areas, supporting the conclusion of faded lanelines as the primary issue.",

This issue is primarily observed in the left lane, where lane markings appear faded and are partially obscured by shadows. The faded markings blend with the road surface, reducing contrast, while shadows from nearby objects further obscure the lane lines. Visual evidence from raw frames shows faded lane lines with shadows partially covering them, supporting the conclusion of faded laneline and occlusion as contributing factors."
