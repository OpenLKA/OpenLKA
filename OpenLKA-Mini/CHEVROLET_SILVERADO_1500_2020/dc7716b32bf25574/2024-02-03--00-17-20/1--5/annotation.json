        "primary_description": "The primary reason for lane detection failure is the faded laneline, which is consistently described as worn and nearly invisible. This issue is exacerbated by low contrast between the lane markings and the road surface, making it difficult for detection systems to accurately identify lane boundaries. The faded condition of the lane lines is a recurring theme across multiple analyses, highlighting its critical impact on detection accuracy.",
        "secondary_reason": "Pavement-Laneline Contrast",
        "secondary_decription": "The secondary reason identified is the low contrast between the pavement and the lane lines. This issue is frequently mentioned alongside faded lanelines, as the combination of worn markings and low contrast significantly hampers the detection process. The blending of lane lines with the road surface is a common observation, leading to incomplete or inaccurate lane detection."
